## ðŸ“Œ 1. User-Story Backlog

Understanding the university's requirements is crucial. Convert these requirements into **user stories**, ensuring they are simple, clear, and structured. Each user story will later translate into a function or action in the system.

Each story is assigned a **unique 3-digit ID**, where the hundreds digit represents the feature group. For example, login-related features may be numbered as follows:

- **101** â†’ Match username and password with stored credentials.  
- **105** â†’ Verify username and password format.  
- **106** â†’ Display an error message for incorrect credentials.  
- **100** â†’ Redirect students to the student subsystem upon successful login.  

These user stories should be formatted into a structured backlog table:

| User Story ID | User      | Action Taken       | Result/Outcome         | Action Name   |
|--------------|----------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 002          | Student  | Register        | Registered Successfully | Registration |
| 003          | Admin    | Create Course   | Course Added           | Course Creation |

## ðŸ“Œ 2. UML Use Case Diagram

Develop a **comprehensive UML use case diagram** by identifying the following elements:

- **Actors** (e.g., Student, Admin, Instructor)  
- **Goals** (e.g., Register, Enroll in Course, Manage Courses)  
- **Use Cases** (e.g., Student Registration, Course Management)  
- **Relationships** (e.g., Associations, Inheritance, Dependencies)  

Each component should be clearly explained to maintain consistency between the diagram and its documentation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. UML Class Diagram

Design a **detailed UML class diagram** by defining the following:

- **Classes** and their responsibilities  
- **Attributes** and their data types  
- **Methods** and their functionality  
- **Visibility** (public, private, protected)  
- **Multiplicity** (one-to-one, one-to-many)  
- **Relationships** between classes (association, aggregation, composition, inheritance)  

Ensure that the explanations align with the diagram to maintain clarity and accuracy.
